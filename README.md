Workflows for amplicon data processing, often based on 3rd party software.
All custom scripts mentioned in the tutorials are also included in this folder.

Amplicons_overlap uses [vsearch](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) to process amplicon libraries where the forward and reverse sequencing reads overlap.

Amplicons_no-overlap does the same for the case where the reads don't (or rarely) overlap. This one is more convoluted, so do try to get overlaps.

Quick_picrust helps you prepare your data for [picrust](http://picrust.github.io/picrust/) analysis if you absolutely refuse to use Qiime or Mothur.
